# Weather App
## My first Angular Project
As a React developer, I've always been curious about new challenges. The Angular framework has been on my radar for a while, and I've finally decided to dive in with this Weather App. This project is my first adventure in the world of Angular.   
## Features
- Updated weather informations using <a href="https://rapidapi.com/worldapi/api/open-weather13">Open Weather API</a>.
